This repository presents the implementation of "Feature Representation for Latent Language Models (LLMs)" and includes two Python libraries, namely protloc-mex1 ([https://pypi.org/project/protloc-mex1/](https://pypi.org/project/protloc-mex1/)) and protloc-mex-x ([https://pypi.org/project/protloc-mex-x/](https://pypi.org/project/protloc-mex-x/)).

For detailed usage instructions regarding these two Python libraries, please refer to the documentation available on PyPI.

Please note that the article is currently under review, and as a result, some code examples have not been publicly disclosed yet. Once the review process is complete, we will make the relevant code examples available for public access.

The raw data regarding train, test, and independent sets have been placed in the "source_data" folder. To transform these raw sequences into corresponding feature representations, and to perform the train and test split, we will refer to the instructions provided in the mentioned Python toolkits. 

For final processed data and feature representations generated during the process, you can contact the "Author 1: Zeyu Luo Email: [1024226968@qq.com]" for access.
